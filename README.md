# Dynamic-UI

To build a dynamic UI in Angular where users can build and configure their own pages, you can follow these general steps:

## Create a widget library:
Create a library of widgets that users can select and add to their page design. Each widget should be a reusable Angular component that can be easily configured by the user.
## Build a drag-and-drop interface:
Create a drag-and-drop interface that allows users to add widgets to their page design. You can use Angular CDK's drag-and-drop functionality to build this interface.
## Allow widget configuration:
Allow users to configure each widget they add to their page design. This can be done by exposing configurable properties on the widget components and providing a UI for the user to modify them.
## Build a service to manage page designs:
Build a service that can save and fetch page designs from a database. This service should allow users to create, update, and delete their page designs.
## Allow users to configure backend REST service URLs:
Add a UI that allows users to configure backend REST service URLs for each widget. This can be done by exposing an input field on each widget component and storing the URL in the widget's configuration.
## Build a preview and publish mechanism:
Add a preview mode that allows users to see what their page design will look like before publishing it. Once the user is satisfied with the design, they can publish it, which will save it to the database and make it available for rendering.
## Render the page:
Finally, create a component that can render the page design. This component should fetch the page design from the database and dynamically create and configure the widget components based on the design.
